  <h3>Info</h3>
  <p>the Golbo-dt (golbo desktop) is a desktop pet. it is a personal project used as a progress tracker for my coding portfolio. Programmed in Java by an absolute beginner over her college term</p>
  <p>Code is open source, free to use with proper credit (you can link my github)</p>
<p>This is considered an unofficial fan project of the Zooliminology project, so shout out to QuietJay and their team for letting me do this with their son.</p>
